# covid-19
The code of this repository adapts [the code developed by Kevin Systrom](https://github.com/k-sys/covid-19) and collaborators for measuring the time-varying reproductive number R_t to the case of Italy.

The code is provided as it is. 
It is just experimental and results can not be considered reliable nor they should be used to derive any policy conclusion.
